    "\n",
    "Python is popular for its simple and relatively straightforward syntax. Its syntax readability increases productivity as it allows us to focus more on the problem rather than structuring the code."

    "### Simple and easy to learn\n",
    "Python has a very simple and elegant syntax. It is much easier to read and write programs in Python compared to other languages like C, C++, or Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this reason, many beginners are introduced to programming with Python as their first programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free and open-source\n",
    "You can freely use and distribute Python programs even for commercial use. As it is open-source, you can even change Python's source code to fit your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portability\n",
    "A single Python program can run on different platforms without any change in source code. It runs on almost all platforms including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensible and Embeddable\n",
    "You can combine Python code with other programming languages like C or Java to increase efficiency. This allows high performance and scripting capabilities that other languages do not provide out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Interpreted Language\n",
    "Python itself handles tasks like memory management and garbage collection. So unlike C or C++, you don't have to worry about system architecture or any other lower-level operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rich library and large community\n",
    "Python has numerous reliable built-in libraries. Python programmers have developed tons of free and open-source libraries, so you don't have to code everything by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python community is very large and evergrowing. If you encounter errors while programming in Python, it's like that it has already been asked and solved by someone in this community."

    "### 1. Simple Elegant Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in Python is fun. It's easier to understand and write Python code. The syntax feels natural. Let's take the following example where we add two numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 2\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "sum = a + b\n",

    "\n",
    "You don't need to define the type of a variable in Python. Also, it's not necessary to add a semicolon at the end of the statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python enforces you to follow good practices (like proper indentation). These small things can make learning much easier for beginners."

    "### 3. The expressiveness of the language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to write programs having greater functionality with fewer lines of code. Let's look at code to swap the values of two variables. It can be done in Python with the following lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 15\n",
    "b = 27\n",
    "print(f'Before swapping: a, b = {a},{b}')\n",
    "a, b = b, a\n",
    "print(f'After swapping: a, b = {a},{b}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can see that the code is very less and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead, we were to use Java, the same program would have to be written in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "public class Swap {\n",
    " public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
    "   int a, b, temp;\n",
    "   a = 15;\n",
    "   b = 27;\n",
    "   System.out.println(\"Before swapping : a, b = \"+a+\", \"+ + b);\n",
    "   temp = a;\n",
    "   a = b;\n",
    "   b = temp;   \n",
    "   System.out.println(\"After swapping : a, b = \"+a+\", \"+ + b);\n",
    " }\n",
    " }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just an example. There are many more such cases where Python increases efficiency by reducing the amount of code required to program something."
