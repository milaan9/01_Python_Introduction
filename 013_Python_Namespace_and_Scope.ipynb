    "\n",
    "Now that we understand what names are, we can move on to the concept of namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simply put it, a namespace is a collection of names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can imagine a namespace as a mapping of every name you have defined to corresponding objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long as the interpreter runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason that built-in functions like **`id()`**, **`print()`** etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each **[module](https://github.com/milaan9/04_Python_Functions/blob/main/007_Python_Function_Module.ipynb)** creates its own global namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "These different namespaces are isolated. Hence, the same name that may exist in different modules do not collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can have various functions and classes. A local namespace is created when a function is called, which has all the names defined in it. Similar, is the case with class. Following diagram may help to clarify this concept.\n",

    "A scope is the portion of a program from where a namespace can be accessed directly without any prefix.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "3. Outermost scope which has built-in names\n",

    "When a reference is made inside a function, the name is searched in the local namespace, then in the global namespace and finally in the built-in namespace.\n",

    "When we are in **`inner_function()`**, **`c`** is local to us, **`b`** is nonlocal and **`a`** is global. We can read as well as assign new values to **`c`** but can only read **`b`** and **`a`** from **`inner_function()`**.\n",
